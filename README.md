## Basic Network Config

The goal of this project is to have a simple Hyperledger network working via docker based upon the basic network from [Basic Network](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/basic-network)
 AND with the Hyperledger Exploer added to the docker-compose.yml.

Follow the startup steps at end of this document then open web browser to access ï¼šhttp://localhost:8090/

The files which were added when compared with basic-network were.

1. The start.sh script was changed a little to add startup of blockchain-explorer-db and blockchain-explorer (referenced in docker-compose.yml).

2. The docker-compose.yml file changed to add blockchain-explorer-db and blockchain-explorer.

3. The postgreSQLdb folder created with creation script which is run from start.sh to populate the postgreSQL database which Hyperledger Explorer uses. This folders contents came from blockchain-explorer/app/persistence/fabric/postgreSQL/db in the blockchain-explorer project.

4. config.json was added and this file gets added to blockchain-explorer.
Its based upon https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/examples/net1/config.json

## To start

1. Run ``./build.sh`` to install tools for generate crypto material.
2. Create the file config.json file which came from  blockchain-explorer/examples/dockerConfig/config.json to match crypt-config.yaml and configtx.yaml
3. Run ``./generate.sh`` to generate the crypto materials.
4. Edit the docker-compose.yml and edit line 18 which currently looks as follows
```
- FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/eace57fae2d22ab50ab9bdeed7575b701d93794d5b3517c7805d6166c5eba67b_sk
```
Change to make its filename match the existing one in this relative directory 
```
./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/ca/
```
Note that the name eace57fae2d22ab50ab9bdeed7575b701d93794d5b3517c7805d6166c5eba67b_sk will be different.

5. Run ``./start.sh`` to startup all.

To stop it, run ``stop.sh``
To completely remove all incriminating evidence of the network
on your system, run ``teardown.sh``.
